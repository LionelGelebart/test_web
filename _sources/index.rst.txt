   user_guide

**AMITEX_FFTP** is a **distributed** solver based on **FFTs** for **non-linear** mechanical simulations 
on **heterogeneous unit-cells** (described by regular 3D images). 
**AMITEX_FFTP** can be run either on individual PC, local clusters or on large **High Performance Computing** 
platforms to perform large scale simulations.

The code combines **massively parallel implementation** with a **versatile user interface**  :

- various complex geometries,
- various loadings conditions,
- various behavior laws (user defined), 
- small strain and finite strain simulations,
- various loadings conditions,
- possiblity to finely tune the outputs.
