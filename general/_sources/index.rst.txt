General description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**AMITEX_FFTP** is a **distributed** solver based on **FFTs** for **non-linear** mechanical simulations on **heterogeneous unit-cells** (described by regular 3D images). 
**AMITEX_FFTP** can be run either on individual PC, local clusters or on large High Performance Computing platforms to perform large scale simulations such as
the example given in the figure below. 

Since recent developments, the usage of **AMITEX_FFTP** can now be divided into two parts :

- The **Standard** usage is based on a user interface described in :ref:`USER <to_begin>`. It doesn't require any code development.  
- The **Extended** usage is mainly devoted to the implementation of various "couplings" (different physics, different codes). It requires code development. **If interested, feel free to contact us.**

The purpose of the further developments are now to :

- stabilize and add new functionalities for the **AMITEX_FFTP-Standard** usage
- facilitate and promote the developments of new "couplings" through the **AMITEX_FFTP-Extended** usage

Code informations 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AMITEX_FFTP is written in modern **FORTRAN** and relies on the **2DECOMP&FFT** library (http://www.2decomp.org) that provides:

* a user-friendly programming interface to work with a 2D pencil decomposition for data distribution on distributed-memory platforms,
* an interface with most popular external FFT libraries,
* parallel I/O.

For the user interface, the reading of XML files in **AMITEX_FFTP** relies on **FoX** (http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~walker/FoX/) a Fortran library for XML.

**FoX** and **2DECOMP&FFT** have been added to the source files of **AMITEX_FFTP**, external libraries are required:

- MPI library : **openMPI** and **intelMPI** implementations are regularly used
- FFT library : **fftw3** is the only library used during developments

Features
^^^^^^^^

The user interface of AMITEX_FFTP allows to:

* "read" the heterogeneous microstructure from VTK files (legacy file format),
* "assign" and "distribute" material behaviors and their corresponding properties over the 2D pencil decomposition proposed by 2decomp.

The mechanical FFT-based solver within AMITEX_FFTP allows to:

* Solve non-linear mechanical problems on unit-cells with prescribed average stress or strain components,
* Solve the problems with the classical fixed-point algorithm (see Moulinec 1994) combined with an acceleration convergence algorithm,
* Choose between a small perturbation or a finite strain framework (mechanics),
* Choose between classical or finite difference based discrete Green operators (better than the classical),
* Use composite voxels for voxels crossed by an interface

The mechanical behavior law is evaluated within a standard **UMAT** procedure which ensures compatibility with both:

* The **CAST3M** (http://www-cast3m.cea.fr) Finite Element software, simplifying the cross comparison between the two codes,
* The **MFront** (http://tfel.sourceforge.net/index.html) code generator, simplifying the process of behavior law implementation.

Of course, the **UMAT** procedure coming from **ABAQUS**, a good compatibility is also expected with this FE code. 


Finally, if the code mainly focuses on mechanics, stationary **diffusion** problems can be solved on unit-cells with prescribed average flux or gradient.
